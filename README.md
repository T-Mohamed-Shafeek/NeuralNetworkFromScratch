# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
This is a project where I have built a Simple Neural Network with 2 hidden layers with 16 neurons in each, from absolute Scratch Using Pure Math and Python¶.

I have used No high-level frameworks like Keras, Tensorflow or Pytorch.

This project is not any innovative solution but an implementation of simple Neural Network (to be more specific, a Multilayered Perceptron ) from scratch using only the theorical Math behind the Neural Nets and Python's Linear Algebra library--NumPy. The network is trained to classify digits in the MNIST dataset.

This project aims to provide a better understanding of the Math and programming behind neural networks by constructing everything from ground-up.

As a best practice, I've included detailed explanatory comments throughout the code to enhance understanding.¶
